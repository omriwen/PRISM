**⚠️ Note**: This file has been consolidated into [AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md](AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md).

Please refer to **[AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md](AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md)** for comprehensive AI assistant guidance.

## Why the change?

Previously, we maintained three separate AI assistant documentation files:
- `CLAUDE.md` (for Claude Code)
- `AGENTS.md` (for Codex CLI)
- `GEMINI.md` (for GEMINI CLI)

These files had significant content overlap and required manual synchronization, which was error-prone and time-consuming. We've consolidated all guidance into a single source of truth: **AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md**.

## Migration Guide

**All AI assistants** should now follow [AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md](AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md), which contains:
- Project overview and architecture
- Development setup and common commands
- Coding standards and best practices
- Testing guidelines
- Commit and PR conventions
- Assistant-specific notes

**This file is kept for backward compatibility and will be removed in a future version.**
